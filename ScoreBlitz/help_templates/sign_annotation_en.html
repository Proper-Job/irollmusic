            This annotation style let's you add fingerings, dynamics, ornaments and articulations into your scores.
            <br />
            The buttons on the left give you quick access to the most recently used annotations.  Tap on any item in this list to quickly insert it into your score.
            <br />
            The slider allows you to precisely adjust the size of the selected annotation.
            <br />
            The reset button resets the annotation to its original size.
            <br />
            Use two fingers to select and edit multiple annotations.
            <br />
            Long press and drag an annotation to move it to a new location.
            <br />
            You can manually resize an annotation by simply dragging out its bottom right edge.
