        Beats per Minute
    </div>
    <p class="description">
        <strong>This setting normally does not need to be changed.</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        You use this setting to enter tempo variations <i>within</i> the piece. 
        <br />
        For instance, if you have a <i>Piu Mosso</i> section, i.e. a section that is faster than the rest of the piece, you would give the measures in that section a slightly higher bpm value.
        <br />
        However, this is usually not the case, so normally you <strong>do not</strong> need to change the <span class="keyword">Beats per Minute</span> default value.
        <br />
        <br />
        Use the <span class="keyword">Metronome</span> in the top toolbar of the <span class="keyword">Roll by Measure</span> performance style to effectively control the playback speed.
