            The <span class="keyword">Manual</span> performance style allows you to work with one page at a time.  Swipe one finger to navigate between pages.<br />
            <br />
            The screen is split along the middle into two <span class="keyword">Tap Zones</span>.  They are active parts of the screen that respond to taps with a single finger.
            <br />
            <br />
            Pressing the <span class="keyword">Right Tap Zone</span> advances the score while pressing the <span class="keyword">Left Tap Zone</span> rewinds the score.  If you're working in landscape orientation, the <span class="keyword">Tap Zones</span> advance and rewind by half a page.
            <br />
            <br />
            You can enable or disable the <span class="keyword">Tap Zones</span> from within the <span class="keyword">App Settings</span>.
            <br />
